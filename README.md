# Basement Administration 
## Kellerverwaltung (Stock Administration)
The aim of this project is to create a tool which helps you to organize your supplies.
## About the project
The creation of the name and the beginning project is a fun story. My apartment is located in the low ground floor and that is why we call it basement ("Keller" in German). Strictly speaking it is a 'suterrain'.
The goal of this poject is taht I don't need a written book for my recipes anymore and that my stock is managed. I always want to be able to have insights on my stock and what i may need to restock.
## Goals
- save your recipes (ingredients, manuel, picture)
- alwasy know how much you have left of one ingredients
- having a statistic of your backing behavior (How much have i baked in the last two month and what?)
- a warning system alerts you when you have not much left of one product (minimum stock)
